Configure API keys Create src/config/apiKeys.ts:
typescript
   export const API_KEYS = {
     OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: 'your_openweather_api_key',
     NEWS_API_KEY: 'your_news_api_key',
   };
   
   export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
     WEATHER_BASE_URL: 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5',
     NEWS_BASE_URL: 'https://newsapi.org/v2',
   };
Run the application
bash
   # Android
   npx react-native run-android
   
   # iOS
   npx react-native run-ios
Application Workflow
Initialization: Request location permissions and detect user location
Data Retrieval: Fetch current weather conditions and forecast data
Condition Analysis: Determine weather category based on temperature thresholds
Content Filtering: Load relevant news content based on weather conditions
Display: Present weather information and filtered news to user
User Interaction: Allow threshold customization and category management

Configuration
Temperature Thresholds
Users can customize temperature ranges for weather condition classification:

Cold Threshold: Default ≤10°C (adjustable: -10°C to 25°C)
Hot Threshold: Default ≥30°C (adjustable: 20°C to 50°C)
Moderate Range: Automatically calculated between thresholds
News Categories
Available categories include:

General
Business
Entertainment
Health
Science
Sports
Technology
